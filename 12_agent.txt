Title: 
Building a Simple Autonomous AI Agent and Simulating Multi-Agent Interaction for Text Based Tasks 
Objective: 
To implement a basic autonomous AI agent using Python that can perform decision-making  in a simulated text-based environment. Extend the simulation to include multiple interacting  agents and analyze their behavior and outcomes. 
Problem Statement: 
This experiment involves creating such agents for text-based tasks and observing their  interactions in a simple simulated scenario. 
Outcome: 
By the end of this experiment, students will be able to: 
∙ Understand the principles of autonomous agents in AI. 
∙ Implement a decision-making agent using basic logic and data structures. ∙ Simulate multi-agent interactions in a text-based environment. 
Theory: 
1. What is an Autonomous AI Agent? 
An autonomous AI agent is a software system that can: 
∙ Sense its environment (e.g., input data or simulated world state), 
∙ Decide on actions using a decision-making process (rules, heuristics, or models), ∙ Act to change the environment or achieve goals. 
In AI, agents are often designed to operate independently, sometimes in coordination with  other agents in multi-agent systems (MAS). 
2. Characteristics of AI Agents 
Feature Description 
Autonomy - Acts without external intervention 
Perception - Interprets input from the environment 
Reasoning - Makes decisions based on goals and data
Action - Affects the environment via outputs or moves 
3. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) 
MAS involves multiple agents that operate in a shared environment. Agents can: ∙ Collaborate to complete complex tasks 
∙ Compete for limited resources 
∙ Negotiate or share information 
4. Text-Based Task Example: Resource Gathering Game 
A simple simulation can be designed where: 
∙ Agents explore a grid-like environment (2D array). 
∙ Each cell contains food, tools, or hazards. 
∙ Agents decide whether to move, collect, avoid, or share resources. ∙ Their state (health, inventory) changes based on decisions. 
5. Agent Design and Logic 
∙ Attributes: name, health, energy, inventory, location. 
∙ Perception: view of nearby grid cells. 
∙ Decision function: rule-based (e.g., "If food nearby, move toward it"). ∙ Action: move, collect, interact. 
6. Key Concepts Demonstrated 
∙ Rule-based decision-making 
∙ Environmental simulation with dynamic updates 
∙ Interaction protocols (e.g., cooperation vs. competition) 
∙ Logging and analysis of agent outcomes 
7. Analysis of Results 
After simulation: 
∙ Track each agent’s score (e.g., resources collected, survival time). 
∙ Compare cooperation vs. competition strategies. 
∙ Analyze which decision rules led to better outcomes. 
∙ Evaluate fairness and effectiveness of agent behavior. 
Conclusion:
This experiment introduces the foundational concept of autonomous and multi-agent  systems. Through a simple Python simulation, students gain practical experience in  designing, implementing, and analyzing the behavior of agents in dynamic environments.  This knowledge connects to real-world AI systems like chatbots, game AI, self-driving  decision systems, and multi-agent coordination frameworks used in robotics and smart  systems.
